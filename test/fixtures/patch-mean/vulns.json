An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.\" [1](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `ms` to version 0.7.1. \n\n## References\n- https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/46\n- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n",
